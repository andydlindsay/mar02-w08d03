# W8D3 End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [ ] Jest vs Cypress
- [ ] Install and Configure Cypress
- [ ] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Jest vs Cypress
- Jest
  - Command line test runner (just like Mocha)
  - More like Express than a framework
  - Assertions-based
  - Doesn't ship with a lot of stuff

- Cypress
  - Test runner
  - Uses a browser
  - Uses your application just like a user
  - Performs operations and interacts with your app
  - Used for integration testing and E2E testing
  - Old friends!! Mocha/Chai, jQuery
